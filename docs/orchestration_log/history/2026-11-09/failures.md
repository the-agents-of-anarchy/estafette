## A secrets auditor printed the lab invitation into its own transcript

What happened: the audit-secrets agent's masking pattern keyed on the value shape and missed the 'invitation: ' prefix of lab/host.txt, so one check printed the whole lab invitation (which carries the lab network's secret) into the agent's tool output, which lives in the harness transcript outside the repository.

Mechanism: a mask applied after the match prints the line when the match fails; the brief told the agent what not to print but not to pipe every grep through a cut that keeps four characters whatever matched.

Correction: the lab network is a throwaway created today and dies with the host at teardown (no rotation of anything durable needed); future audit briefs order every search output through 'cut -c1-<prefix+4>' or an awk mask applied to every line, never a match-dependent mask; .gitignore gains .env, *.key, *.certs/ and lab data paths (tooling change launched).
